# Topre_R2_RGB_Reference
Reference files for the Topre R2 RGB keyboards. Includes cutouts and models for 1U, and 2U, plus cutouts for 3U, and 7U/10U.

Important Notes:

- RGB plate cutouts are offset from switch center by 0.2mm, so make 100% sure that you follow the centerpoint shown in the cutout files for the exact center you should reference.
- RGB stabs are offset from the normal MX spacing due to topre housings being too wide to fit in the MX spacing of 0.94in(23.876mm) center to center. They are instead 28.276mm, or each stem is offset by 2.2mm.
- RGB housings are designed to have the LED cutout north side, and stabs north side as well. In the cases where this isn't possible (example 2U backspace can be an issue with cases) you will need to flip the stabs and the switches immediately below that row. You may need to flip more than just the row below depending, but you can have two LED cutouts facing each other as you can get away with it in most offsets and even in situations where they do hit (the LED cutouts are inline) then you can trim the protrusion on the housing as it is only used for LED light redirection (it is an RGB LED light pipe afterall).
- CAD models aren't 100% accurate but are the best I was able to measure and will function for testing/reference and possibly more but I make no guarantee of the accuracy of every single detail that you might be interested in knowing.
